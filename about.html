      <!-- Author and course information -->
      <p><strong>Author:</strong> Jayden Rodriguez-Barnett</p>
      <p><strong>Course:</strong> IT 3203 — Introduction to Web Development</p>

      <p><strong>Project:</strong> Milestone 2 — Dynamic Frontend with Quiz</p>

      <!-- Description of the purpose of the site -->
      <p>
        This site summarizes my research on the evolution of HTTP across versions 0.9/1.0, 1.1, 2, and 3,
        with emphasis on the 2022 specification refactor and QUIC&apos;s role in HTTP/3. The goal is to give
        students a clear, high-level overview of how HTTP has changed over time while preserving its core semantics.
      </p>

      <p>
        For Milestone 2, I extended the original content with an interactive self-assessment quiz, additional
        explanations on key concepts, and small layout and style refinements. The quiz page allows visitors
        to test their understanding of HTTP versions, performance features, and protocol design trade-offs.

      <h2>Technologies and Site Structure</h2>
      <p>
        This project is built with semantic HTML, a shared external CSS file, and a small amount of JavaScript
        for form handling and quiz logic. Navigation is consistent across all pages to make it easy to explore:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li><strong>Home:</strong> Introduces the topic and motivation.</li>
        <li><strong>Origins:</strong> Early HTTP (0.9/1.0) and basic request/response ideas.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP/1.1 &amp; HTTP/2:</strong> Persistent connections, pipelining, and multiplexing.</li>
        <li><strong>HTTP/3 (QUIC):</strong> UDP-based transport, connection migration, and reduced latency.</li>
        <li><strong>Key Concepts:</strong> Core ideas that connect the different HTTP versions.</li>
        <li><strong>Quiz:</strong> Self-assessment on the evolution and design of HTTP.</li>
        <li><strong>References:</strong> Sources and further reading.</li>
