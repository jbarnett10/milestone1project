IT3203 Milestone 2
==================

This milestone expands on the Milestone 1 site by adding an interactive **quiz page** and improving accessibility, responsiveness, and site structure.

Additions and enhancements:
- **quiz.html** — A five-question interactive quiz that provides real-time scoring and feedback.
- Implemented JavaScript to evaluate quiz answers, calculate total score, and show pass/fail status.
- Confirmed unified styling through the existing `style.css`.
- Ensured full site responsiveness and cross-page design consistency.
