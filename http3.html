  <h2>HTTP/3 on QUIC</h2>
  <!-- Paragraph describing HTTP/3 and QUIC basics -->
  <p>
    <strong>HTTP/3</strong> maps HTTP onto <strong>QUIC</strong>, a <b>UDP-based, encrypted transport protocol</b> 
    that provides per-stream multiplexing, fast handshakes (1-RTT/0-RTT), and connection migration. 
    By handling multiplexing at the transport layer, HTTP/3 avoids the <b>head-of-line blocking</b> 
    that limited HTTP/2's performance when packets were lost.
  </p>
   <!-- Paragraph on TLS 1.3 integration and reliability benefits -->
  <p>
    <b>QUIC</b> integrates <b>TLS 1.3</b> and is widely supported by browsers and CDNs, improving speed and stability 
    on mobile and lossy networks. Stream-level recovery means a lost packet doesn't stall other requests, 
    making <b>HTTP/3</b> ideal for variable connections.
  </p>
  <!-- Concluding paragraph summarizing advantages -->
  <p>
    Together, these innovations make <b>HTTP/3</b> the fastest and most resilient version of the protocol to date.
