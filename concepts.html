      <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
      <!-- Introductory text -->
      <p>
        These core ideas appear across HTTP versions and help explain why the protocol could evolve
        without breaking the way applications think about requests and responses.
      </p>
      <!-- Unordered list of HTTP concepts -->
      <ul>
        <li>
          <strong>HTTP Semantics:</strong> Stable methods, status codes, headers, and URIs define how clients
          and servers talk to each other, regardless of which version or transport is underneath.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Statelessness:</strong> Each request is independent; servers do not automatically remember
          previous requests. Features like cookies, sessions, and tokens are layered on top to provide continuity.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Persistent Connections:</strong> HTTP/1.1 reuses a TCP connection for multiple requests,
          which reduces handshake overhead and improves throughput compared to one-connection-per-request.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Multiplexing:</strong> HTTP/2 and HTTP/3 allow many streams over a single connection so that
          multiple resources can be fetched in parallel without opening extra connections.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>HPACK:</strong> The header compression format in HTTP/2 that removes repeated header bytes
          across requests, shrinking bandwidth usage on chatty sites.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>QUIC:</strong> A UDP-based transport with built-in encryption and stream multiplexing that
          underpins HTTP/3 and improves performance on lossy and mobile networks.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Head-of-Line Blocking:</strong> In TCP, a single lost packet can stall later data on the same
          connection. QUIC reduces this by handling streams independently at the transport layer.
        </li>
        <li>
          <strong>Version Independence:</strong> Modern specs separate shared semantics (RFC 9110) from individual
          mappings (HTTP/1.1, HTTP/2, HTTP/3), so applications can think in “HTTP terms” while the wire format evolves.
        </li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        Together, these concepts show how HTTP kept its core semantics stable while evolving the transport layer
        from simple one-request-per-connection behavior to multiplexed, encrypted, QUIC-based delivery.
