      <h2>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2</h2>

      <!-- Summary of HTTP/1.1 features -->
      <p>
        <strong>HTTP/1.1</strong> standardized persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, virtual
        hosting via the <code>Host</code> header, and a mature caching model. It became the default across
        major web servers and browsers for roughly two decades.
      </p>

      <!-- Summary of HTTP/2 changes and their impact -->
      <p>
        <strong>HTTP/2</strong> (2015) preserved HTTP semantics but introduced a binary framing layer that
        multiplexes many streams over a single TCP connection and compresses headers using HPACK. This design
        reduces handshake overhead and latency compared to the one-stream-per-connection approach in HTTP/1.1.
        Priority signaling was simplified in later updates, and server push saw limited benefit and is now
        disabled by default in Chrome.
      </p>

      <!-- Practical outcome for users/developers -->
      <p>
        In practice, multiplexing lets browsers fetch many resources in parallel without opening extra connections,
        while header compression eliminates repeated metadata. Users see faster page loads and fewer stalls on
        image-heavy or script-heavy sites, and developers can rely less on workarounds like domain sharding and
        resource inlining.
      </p>

      <!-- Closing statement -->
      <p>
        Together, HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2 transformed HTTP from a simple text-based protocol into a more efficient,
        scalable foundation for the modern web, paving the way for HTTP/3 and QUIC.
