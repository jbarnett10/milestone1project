  <h2>HTTP/1.1 and HTTP/2</h2>
  <!-- Summary of HTTP/1.1 features -->
  <p>
    <strong>HTTP/1.1</strong> standardized persistent connections, chunked transfer encoding, virtual
    hosting via <code>Host</code>, and a mature caching model. It became the default across major servers
    for two decades.
  </p>
   <!-- Summary of HTTP/2 changes and their impact -->
  <p>
    <strong>HTTP/2</strong> (2015) preserved semantics but added a binary framing layer that multiplexes
    many streams over a single TCP connection and compresses headers (HPACK). This reduced handshake
    overhead and latency compared to the one-stream-per-connection model. Priority signaling has since
    been simplified, and server push saw limited benefit and is disabled by default in Chrome.
  </p>
   <!-- Practical outcome for users/developers -->
<p>
    In practice, multiplexing lets browsers fetch many resources at once without opening extra connections,
    while header compression removes repeated metadata. Users see faster page loads and fewer stalls, especially on image-heavy sites.
    </p>
    <!-- Closing statement -->
    <p>
  Together, these versions transformed HTTP from a simple text-based system to a robust foundation for the modern web.
