      <h2>Origins of HTTP: 0.9 and 1.0</h2>
      <!-- Description of CERN and Tim Berners-Lee -->
      <p>
        The web began at
        <a href="https://home.cern/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">CERN</a>
        in the early 1990s, where
        <a href="https://www.w3.org/People/Berners-Lee/" target="_blank" rel="noopener">Tim Berners-Lee</a>
        proposed a distributed hypertext system. The first stack combined URLs, HTML, and HTTP, demonstrated on
        <code>info.cern.ch</code>. The WorldWideWeb browser/editor showed how HTTP could connect authors and readers
        through a simple request–response model.
      </p>

      <!-- Explanation of HTTP/0.9 and HTTP/1.0 -->
      <p>
        <strong>HTTP/0.9</strong> defined a single <code>GET</code> method that returned an untyped HTML payload.
        There were no headers and no content negotiation. <strong>HTTP/1.0</strong> (1996) added request and response
        headers, media types, basic caching, and methods like <code>HEAD</code> and <code>POST</code>. Most servers
        still used short-lived connections (one request per TCP connection), which later motivated performance work
        in HTTP/1.1 and beyond.
      </p>

      <!-- Closing summary of early impact -->
      <p>
        These early versions defined the core request–response pattern and content typing that still shape the web.
        By introducing headers, methods, and media negotiation, HTTP/1.0 enabled richer pages and laid the groundwork
        for the later focus on efficiency and scalability.
